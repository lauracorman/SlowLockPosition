Note :

This program aims at rectifying the position of a beam for an ultracold atom experiment.
It is provided without any guaranty.

It was designed for a system
- controled by the Cicero experiment control
- the beam position is monitored on a Lumenera camera
- the beam position is controled using PicoMotors from NewFocus from the ethernet port

at each start of an experimental run, Cicero sends an ethernet message to the program, which takes a picture, fits it and retroacts 3 times. 

The lock was tested (see Asservissement_Position_Verdi.pdf) to be enough for our purposes. Please contact me for any question.
